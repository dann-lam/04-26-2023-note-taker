## Description

[Visit the Deployed Site]()

This is an app that reads and writes notes to a .json file.

It utilizes Express on the backend to return fetch calls from the front, it then "records" the inputs into a JSON file.

You will be greeted with a page, upon entering it'll activate a script to pull back whatever was recorded into a JSON file, upon closing the server your files will be recorded.

## Learning Points

This project was a fantastic exercise of express, it was actually pretty difficult for me as some of the concepts were not quite solid, and there was quite a bit of struggle trying to understand why some of my promises were not returning! At the end of the day, we figured out what was occurring and all was well.
